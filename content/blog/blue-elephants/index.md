description: This isn't really a happy post. Ever since last year, I've written a lot about my relationship with my family in the forms of memos, diary entries, garbled words... It feels very fragile and delicate, with small fissures that only I seem to be able to see, but I'm mostly comfortable with how things are right now. So I hope that this is the final piece I will write about this topic, and I hope I can make peace with myself.

I always thought she might be French. *Les enphants*, I mean, it does sound posh enough. French in blood or not, however, I know she’s really from an old house at the end of an alley in the warm south. My cousins’ place, actually.

She was originally my cousin’s, but I fell in love with her when I visited. My aunt made him give her to me, and the rest is history. 

One year for Christmas, my aunt and uncle got me a toy crib. The bottom of the crib was just a piece of pink cardboard balanced on three plastic bars, but it was perfect, complete with a crib mobile with a stuffed moon and three stars. Then an only child, I regarded her as the sibling I never had.

Everywhere I went with my family she also went. She was there when we had sweet mung bean soup in the boiling city at the southern tip of Taiwan. I wanted her to try some as well, but my mom took her away. *You’ll get her dirty, and then I’ll have to go through all the trouble of cleaning her*. 

Eventually I grew older, old enough to realize why I wasn’t allowed to feed her any food during dinner, why she wouldn’t respond whenever I talked to her until I pretended that she did. Old enough to notice her flaws, like how her nose looks asymmetrical in the mirror, and old enough to lie to her to make her feel better about it. *Don’t look; the mirror is lying to you. You look beautiful*. She never grew older, so I hope she still believes me. 

And for a long while, she seemed like the only person that I could confide in. It started with something stupid really, from my dad taking me to get a pair of new shoes. It was hot, and I just wanted to go home, so I picked a pair of sneakers that were slightly too large. 

The next day in PE we did a timed two hundred-meter run. I didn’t try my best because I was afraid my shoes would come off. My dad found out and stopped talking to me for four months. 

I started heading to my room early to avoid confrontation, and she was there, always smiling, her short little hands wide open for a hug. My room turned into a factory of sorts, where I cut us both open and stuffed cotton inside me and whatever inside me that hurt back into her.

She moved into my closet when I left for Canada. There she waited for me, winter, summer, summer, alone, unseen, unheard. 

I know she saw me, though, as I walked from my dorm to the library at night, turned my head towards Pedder Bay, and wondered what it would be like to let myself sleep in the waves. I saw her, too, as the years made me even lighter and her heavier. 

I used to weigh three sentences, and now I only weigh one. If I get any heavier, the delicate balance that is my family, that is myself will fall apart. I’m sure they’ve all made similar sacrifices, so by even writing this essay I feel like I’m being ungrateful. 

When I returned last summer, I was surprised to see how much shabbier she looked. The round part of her belly looked more dark green than blue; her fingertips were no longer snow white. I know most people my age no longer keep stuffed animals, and if they do, they don’t carry the same weight as she does for me. But for some reason, I still refuse to move on, so I tucked her back into the closet when I left last fall, and so will I this year. 

Maybe one day, in an alternate universe where I don’t lift my head and marvel at how beautiful the moon is, I’ll exit my room through the window while the door remains slightly ajar, just enough for you to see, the blue elephant in my room.
