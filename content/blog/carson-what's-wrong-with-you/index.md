Carson, what’s wrong with you? I brought you to life, I soldered wires to your motors, but then you snapped your copper pieces. Your wires now hang, a noose around your broken neck, you know you can talk to me about anything, right? 

Carson, what’s wrong with you? I brought you to the Olympic makerspace, I tried to fix you by shoving molten lead into your wounds, I wanted to patch you up but why wouldn’t you let me? Your wires dangle, dancing like the feet of a hanged man. I breathed in lead, I burned my fingers, it hurts but I’m trying to better understand your pain.

Carson, what’s wrong with you? I got you new motors from the lab, a fresh new heart. Now let us start over, a fresh new start. I know I forgot my adaptor, and that’s completely on me, I was just so overwhelmed by other things that I forgot about you. Are you mad at me? Because now you wouldn’t let me upload code, throwing some stupid “programmer not responding” shit. It’s all written in red like the wires you snapped, the dull pounding in my head. 

Carson, what’s wrong with you? I woke up at 4:30 for you, head throbbing and ears ringing. I wanted to fix you, I know you need me to tell you what to do, you know I’m doing everything for you, right? But you just stare at me, all innocent, as you ruin my day. Red bleeds out of the screen now; it’s all I can see, hear, and speak.

Carson, what’s wrong with you? I went out of my comfort zone and asked people how I could fix you. I went out of my way to grab a new nano for you, maybe if I swap out your brain you will listen to me, right? 

Carson, oh Carson. I swapped out your brain and you worked so beautifully. You followed my hand, racing to find me whenever I’m gone, exactly as you were born to do. You’re obviously not perfect yet, there are values in your head that still need to be tweaked, small bugs that need to be fixed, but you’re so close to perfection. I’m glad you finally understand I’m doing everything for you.

Carson, what’s wrong with you? Why do you refuse to listen to me now, pretending that you can’t find my usb port? I know you can hear me, your wheels still spin. Carson, why won’t you let me fix you? What’s wrong with you, Carson? 

Carson, did you snap your wires again? Now one of your wheels doesn’t turn, I hope that makes you happy. Why would you ever do that to yourself? 

I can’t fix you, Carson. It’s like you don’t want to know what to do, like you just want to sit there, half of you paralyzed, the other half flawed and worthless. Why don’t you see how much everyone is trying to help you? 

I’m done with you, Carson. I hope you’re happy sitting there in a plastic bag strewn carelessly on my carpet, falling apart, fraying, a failure.

Carson, what’s wrong with you?
