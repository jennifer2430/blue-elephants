Twenty-eight degrees  
Celsius, not Fahrenheit, mind you  
February  
    *whispers: but it felt like june*

Doing track and field  
On the track  
Track my best record  
The sun was in my eyes, and I lost  
Track  

There was this dude on the skateboard  
blond, skating  
Down the hill  
One of his legs trailing  
I could hear the soul of his sneakers  
Hissing against the sidewalk  
It must hurt so much  
Bearing pain for something bigger  
And more powerful  
And having no one  
Ache for you  

We college students  
Jaywalk  
Why is it called jaywalking  
My dear bluejay  
Press the button

    *I did*  

        *that lazy white pixel guy must be slacking off again*  

Somewhere  
In the back of my head  
Someone  
Planted a camera  
And they’re keeping track  

Track and field  
Have you lost track yet  

Speedwalking now  
To Powell  
Moment of inertia, rota  
Tions  

The earth is rotating  
At the speed of light  
Given the earth’s radius  
Calculate its angular velocity  

*but professor, professor, wouldn’t we all be dead   
        If earth was rotating at the speed of light*

    *dear child, look around you and tell me  
        Are things any different  
        with earth rotating at the speed of  
            Roughly 2pi / 86400 rad/s*  

        *Now shoo, shoo  
            Have fun in the meadows with your peers  
            Enjoy the sun  
                And be glad humans haven’t harnessed   the power of  
                    Nuclear fusion*  

I went out  
And planted trees  
On the blackboard,  
    On my ipad  
        And later I will plant another on leetcode 

It was still twenty-eight when I walked back  
Track and field  
    , Tennis court  
What's the score now?  
    I didn’t keep track  
That’s ok,  
    Tis a beautiful day after all  

Track my footprints  
My carbon footprint  
It’s so bright and peaceful  
    On a grove of dead trees  

There are no cracks on the pavement outside Rieber

*and so many cracks elsewhere*  

    *I lied, love, just squint a little harder*

It’s a peaceful age  
    Only for the lucky people  

Track and field  
Keeping track of  
    How lucky I’ve been  
I’ve scraped my knee  
    And broken my teeth  
Somewhere,  
    Someone  
        Is keeping track  
I hope that’s all I’ll ever break.
